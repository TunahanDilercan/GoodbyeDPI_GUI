This software is a simplified graphical interface (GUI) for the working version of GoodbyeDPI.  
<a href="README.md" hreflang="tr">

</a>

It is based on the [GoodbyeDPI](https://github.com/ValdikSS/GoodbyeDPI) and [GoodbyeDPI-Turkey](https://github.com/cagritaskn/GoodbyeDPI-Turkey) projects. This tool aims to bypass Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) blocks and is presented with a minimal interface controllable via the system tray.

The project is precompiled along with the original DPI bypass engine and runs directly with script compatibility.

## Installation

1. Download the `GoodbyeDpiGUI.rar` file from the GitHub "Releases" section.
2. Extract it to any folder (no installation required).
3. Right-click and select **Run as Administrator**.
4. The app will sit in the system tray and can be started/stopped via the tray icon.

> Use the **Exit** button to completely close the application. In the event of a crash, it does not leave behind any residual files.

---

## Usage

When you run `GoodbyeDPI-GUI.exe`, the application will automatically minimize to the system tray and start running silently in the background to bypass DPI.  
You can right-click the tray icon to **start/stop** the app or select **Exit** to fully close it.

> Use the **Exit** button to completely terminate the app. In case of any crash, it leaves no file remnants behind.

## Kaspersky Warning

Kaspersky antivirus software may block GoodbyeDPI from functioning correctly. Disabling it is not always sufficient; a complete removal is recommended. Alternatively, use more compatible antivirus solutions such as Windows Defender.

---

## Common Issues

- **WinDivert error**: Some antivirus programs may block critical files. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus or adding the application to the exception list.
- **Discord update stuck**: Discord may fail to update if it detects network restrictions. After bypassing DPI, update Discord while using a VPN, then switch back to your normal connection.
- **Some sites load slowly or not at all**: This can occur when the app isn't running or DPI bypass fails. Ensure the app is active through the GUI.
